> *Composable external iteration.*

If you have found yourself with a *collection* of some kind, and needed to perform
an operation on the elements of said collection, you will quickly run into *iterators*.
Iterators are heavily used in idiomatic Python code, so becoming familiar with them is essential.

## Installing

**Python 3.7 or above is required.**

### pip

Installing the library with `pip` is quite simple:

```console
$ pip install iters
```

Alternatively, the library can be installed from source:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/nekitdev/iters.git
$ cd iters
$ python -m pip install .
```

### poetry

You can add `iters` as a dependency with the following command:

```console
$ poetry add iters
```

Or by directly specifying it in the configuration like so:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
iters = "^0.3.0"
```

Alternatively, you can add it directly from the source:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies.iters]
git = "https://github.com/nekitdev/iters.git"
```

## Examples

### Simple

Squaring only even numbers in some sequence:

```python
from iters import iter


def is_even(value: int) -> bool:
    return not value % 2


def square(value: int) -> int:
    return value * value


numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

result = iter(numbers).filter(is_even).map(square).list()

print(result)  # [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
```

### Asynchronous

Asynchronous iteration is fully supported by `iters`, and its API is similar to its
synchronous counterpart.
